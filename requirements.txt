This file contains all the setup needed to run our code. Our code was run on Google Colab which means we did not have to install any environment / packages.

The Dataset is available at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ujAD2dnhsZ6ZLCeC5Ofk3leqiW_bv8UH?usp=sharing

The packages to install are the following : 

- NumPy     (to handle numpy arrays)
- Pandas    (to create dataframe that are easy to edit)
- PyTorch   (the core functions of all the models, neural networks, datasets, dataloaders)
- SKlearn   (used for cross-validation)
- Matplotlib(used for visualisation purposes)
- Seaborn   (used for visualisation purposes)
- google.colab (to import files from google drive directly)
- Vit pytorch (used for the visual transformer)
- pickle (to save the result of the model)
- collections (to count hashable object)
             
Some other libraries that do not need packages :

- os (to handle file loading)
- sys (to handle file loading)
- time (to evaluate execution time)
- datetime (to have datetime class that is easier to handle)
- itertools (create combinations of lists for cross-validation)
